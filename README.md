NutritionInfo.jsx: Nutritional data for dishes
These are UI components that can be reused in multiple pages. Each .jsx file is a functional component, and each .css file styles it.

2. src/context/
Holds React Context API logic for global state:
CartContext.jsx: Manages cart state (add/remove, total price)
MenuContext.js: Manages menu data and filters
This folder manages global states like cart and menu without prop drilling.

3. src/data/
Static data used throughout the app:
menuData.js: Contains hardcoded dish information
This file stores hardcoded menu data used to populate the menu page.

HomePage.jsx & .css: Landing page
MenuPage.jsx & .css: Full dish menu
Each file here is a full page or route, composed of reusable components.

api.js: API functions
apiConfig.js: Stores endpoints/config
integration.js: Backend connection logic
tests.js: Optional API test functions
This folder handles API calls and backend integration logic.

6. src/Styles/
Global/shared CSS styles:
components.css
main.css

These provide consistent styling across the app.

7. Core Files
App.jsx & App.css: Main component handling routes and layout
App.test.js: App-level test file
index.js: App entry point
index.css: Global CSS rules
App.jsx is the core component, index.js is the starting point, and index.css sets global styles.

## As bonus features,
As bonus features, I implemented several enhancements to improve user experience and functionality. A search bar was added to allow users to easily filter and find dishes by name. The entire application is built with a responsive design, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices. To highlight new items, a "New Arrival" badge automatically appears on dishes with fewer than 10 views. Additionally, I implemented a persistent cart using localStorage, so users' cart items are saved even after a page refresh. A key addition is the nutrition information feature, which displays detailed nutritional facts for each dish‚Äîhelping users make more informed dietary choices. I also built essential pages like the MenuPage, which displays all available dishes; the AboutPage, which provides background information about the app or business; and the Footer, which includes helpful links and contact info displayed at the bottom of every page.
